- cache first: https://ajputnam.github.io/offline-web-apps/service_workers/cache_first/
- cache only: https://ajputnam.github.io/offline-web-apps/service_workers/cache_only/
- as you go: https://ajputnam.github.io/offline-web-apps/service_workers/download_as_you_go/

## Why its cool
* Allows the website/web-app to function offline
* Improved app performance 
* More options than app cache


## Problems Service works
- The spec is still being worked on
- Browser support
- can be difficult to debug
