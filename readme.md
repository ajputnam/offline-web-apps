# Offline web apps
This repository was created to show different ways to create offline web apps. 
As well as providing information I have found helpful.

### Todays examples
- http://arthurputnam.com/playground/app_cache/basic/index.html
- https://ajputnam.github.io/offline-web-apps/app_cache/basic/
- cache first: https://ajputnam.github.io/offline-web-apps/service_workers/cache_first/
- cache only: https://ajputnam.github.io/offline-web-apps/service_workers/cache_only/
- as you go: https://ajputnam.github.io/offline-web-apps/service_workers/download_as_you_go/

### Offline Technologies
* Application Cache (web)
* Service Workers (web)
* Electron &| Cordova (native)

### Why offline?
- **Improving UX** 
- Providing an offline experience 
- Reduce data usage
- Increase device battery life
- apps that act like native apps
- increase load times
- faster deployment, larger reach
- build once, deploy ever where

### Other use cases
- Offline documentation
- Apps that don't need the web at all 
- offline Games (download and play)


### Common connection struggles
- airplanes
- elevators, tunnels 
- roaming data charges
- "full bars" but still getting spinners...


### When to consider Electron or Cordova
- basically when you need system level access 
- Native file IO
- running other programs
- make use of OS notification 
- make use of other program or libraries
- Use OS tray icons


### Dev Tips:
- shift thinking from web app to native app on the web
- Turn off live reload (mainly with app cache)
- Test on real dev stack
- use chrome debug tools
- test using offline mode and airplane mode
- use gitlab or github for free HTTPS hosting & testing
